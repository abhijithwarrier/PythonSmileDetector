# PythonSmileDetector
PYTHON GUI TO DETECT FACE AND SMILE IN AN IMAGE USING OpenCV LIBRARY

OpenCV-Python is a library of Python bindings designed to solve computer vision problems. OpenCV-Python makes use of
Numpy, which is a highly optimized library for numerical operations with a MATLAB-style syntax. All the OpenCV array
structures are converted to and from Numpy arrays. This also makes it easier to integrate with other libraries that
use Numpy such as SciPy and Matplotlib.

### The module can be installed using the command - pip install opencv-python
